# con-angular-apps
When I worked at the CU College of Nursing, I had the opportunity to build a POC applications for faculty to manage their workload; I used Angular and PHP; this was my first foray into full-stack development. I also had a bit of downtime to tinker and built a few random applications using Angular. Though none of the applications in this repo were implemented, I did gain valuable practice and experience with the Angular framework.
